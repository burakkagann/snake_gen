Phase 1: Design System & Aesthetic Foundation

    - Color Palette: Implement neon-inspired colors (cyan, magenta, electric blue, neon
     green) with dark backgrounds
    - Typography: Add retro-futuristic fonts (explore options like "Orbitron" or 
    similar sci-fi typefaces)
    - Visual Elements: Enhance circuit board patterns, add glowing effects, scan lines,
     and holographic-style elements
    - Button Design: Create neon-outlined buttons with glow effects and futuristic 
    borders

    Phase 2: Screen Enhancement (Top to Bottom Priority)

    - Add animated neon snake logo with glow effects
    - Implement holographic-style buttons with scan line animations
    - Enhanced circuit board background with animated elements
    - Add "SYSTEM ONLINE" or similar sci-fi status indicators

    2. Manual Gameplay - "Mission Control HUD"
    - Redesign top bar as a futuristic HUD interface
    - Add glowing borders and neon accent colors
    - Implement sci-fi style game over screen with terminal aesthetics
    - Add matrix-style text effects and animations

    3. Pre-trained AI Selection - "AI Unit Database"
    - Design as a futuristic AI selection terminal
    - Create glowing profile cards for each AI model
    - Add animated selection indicators with neon highlights
    - Implement hover effects with electric/energy themes

    4. Training Setup - "Neural Network Configuration"
    - Style as a scientific control panel interface
    - Add futuristic form elements with glowing inputs

    5. Training/Gameplay Interface - "Real-time Monitoring System"
    - Design advanced HUD with multiple data panels
    - Add animated parameter displays with sci-fi meters
    - Implement glowing sidebar information panels
    - Create terminal-style generation tracking display

    Phase 3: Interactive & Animation Elements

    - Neon Glow Effects: Buttons, borders, and text highlights
    - Scan Line Animations: Subtle moving scan lines across interfaces
    - Holographic Transitions: Fade/materialize effects for screen changes
    - Energy Pulse Effects: For active elements and buttons
    - Matrix-style Text: For data displays and status information

    Phase 4: Audio-Visual Consistency

    - Consistent neon color scheme across all interfaces
    - Unified spacing and grid system
    - Standardized glow and animation timing
    - Cohesive sci-fi terminology and UI language

    Technical Implementation

    - Update Menu.py, Snake-Gen-v11.5.py, and Manual_gameplay.py
    - Add custom color constants for neon palette
    - Implement glow effects using pygame drawing techniques
    - Create reusable UI components for consistency
    - Maintain all existing functionality while enhancing visual appeal
