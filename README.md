# 🐍 Snake Gen

## Overview
This project is a **genetic algorithm-based Snake AI** that allows:
- **Manual Play** 🕹️ (Control the snake yourself)
- **AI Training Mode** 🤖 (Train an AI to optimize survival & food collection)
- **Pre-Trained AI Mode** 🧠 (Use pre-trained models with optimized strategies)

The game leverages **`pygame`** for rendering, **`numpy`** for AI calculations, and **a genetic algorithm** for evolving AI behavior.

## **Introduction**
Welcome to **AI Snake**, where you can either **train an AI** to play Snake or take control yourself!  
Using **evolutionary principles**, the AI learns **optimal movement strategies**, balancing **exploration and efficiency**.  
This project was developed to demonstrate **machine learning in a game-based environment**.

### 3️⃣ Pre-Trained AI Mode
- Select from **pre-trained AI models** with **different strategies**:
  - **Hunter:** Aggressively moves towards food.
  - **Strategist:** Balances food-seeking & survival.
  - **Explorer:** Explores more before committing.
  - **Risk-Taker:** Moves quickly but takes high risks.
  - **AI-Mastery:** Advanced AI with optimized weights.
- **Watch how different strategies perform!**
